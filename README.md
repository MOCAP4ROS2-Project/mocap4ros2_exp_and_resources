## Guide

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/IntelligentRoboticsLabs/MOCAP4ROS2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/IntelligentRoboticsLabs/MOCAP4ROS2)

To use this project is important follow the next steps.
First of all, we have to download the dependencies packages. We will use **vcs-tool**
  ```
    cd [ros2_ws]/src
    git clone https://github.com/IntelligentRoboticsLabs/mocap4ros2_project.git
  ```
  If you want to install the vicon packages you have to run the next command:
  ```
    vcs import < mocap4ros2_project/vicon.repos
  ```
  If you want to install the technaid packages you have to run the next command:
  ```
    vcs import < mocap4ros2_project/technaid.repos
  ```
